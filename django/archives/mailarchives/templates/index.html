<h2>What are the PostgreSQL Mailing Lists?</h2>

The <a href="https://lists.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL mailing lists</a> are one of the primary ways to interact with the PostgreSQL community. The mailing lists are an effective way to communicate and contribute to PostgreSQL and there are lists that cover a variety of topics, including:

<ul>
  <li>Ongoing PostgreSQL development</li>
  <li>General support</li>
  <li>Product release &amp; event announcements</li>
  <li>Coordinate community outreach</li>
</ul>

and many more.

<h2>Tips For Using the PostgreSQL Mailing Lists</h2>

<p>To help ensure you have a productive experience on the PostgreSQL experience, we have a few tips to get you started on your journey:</p>

<h3>Tip #1: Read The Archives Policy</h3>

<p>The PostgreSQL mailing lists are available in a public archive and are independently syndicated across the web. We want you to feel comfortable posting to our public mailing lists, so please ensure you read our <a
 href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/policies/archives/">Archive Policy</a> prior to your initial post.</p>

<h3>Tip #2: Avoid Mail-Back Anti-Spam Systems</h3>

<p>If your email address is protected by a mail-back anti-spam system, this could cause some issues with our mailing list system. If it is discovered that your email address has implemented one of these systems, we may have to automatically unsubscribe your account.
</p>

<h3>Tip #3: Choose The Most Appropriate List</h3>

<p>Choose the most appropriate individual list for your question.  Please do not cross-post (have multiple mailing lists in one email) unless there is a specific reason (such as a confirmed bug report being cross-posted to the hackers mailing list).  Instead, choose the most appropriate list for your email and send it there.  Cross-posted emails will be moderated and therefore will also take longer to reach the subscribers if approved.
